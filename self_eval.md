# Self Evaluation

- __What did you struggle with in this section?__
At first sight the hashes lesson seemed daunting...it looked very complex on the surface, yet once I started reading the material and working the the practice code I found it pretty straight-forward and caught on quickly.
- __How is note-taking going? What are you finding helpful? When do you find yourself taking the most helpful notes?__
I am definitely taking better notes now than I have in the past. I found that leaving myself more room between sections than I used to helps when I want to go back and add details. Also, using different colored pens really helps notes stand out and makes information easier to go back and find.
- __What do you lean into - Googling, or trying to solve a problem in code on your own first?__
I try figuring it out by trying code before I Google anything.
